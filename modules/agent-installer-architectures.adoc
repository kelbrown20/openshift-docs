= Optional: Verifying architectures on the Agent-based installer 

You can check which architecture your {product-title} agent installer cluster is using by viewing the version binary.

.Prerequisites: 

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc)
* You have the openshift-installer binary

.Procedure: 

. Check your release payload by running the following command: 
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ ./openshift-install version
----
+
.Example output 
[source,terminal]
----
./openshfit-install 4.15.z

release image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:27d41f99e0784a2f596e773799983147b794df48d1f7536d51a95a60945b1931
release architecture amd64
----

If you are using the `multi` installer payload, the `release architecture` output of this command displays the architecture of the host where the installer is running. 

. To verify that you are using your preferred architecture, run the following example command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ oc adm release info <release-image> -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----
+
.Example command that uses a release-image
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:27d41f99e0784a2f596e773799983147b794df48d1f7536d51a95a60945b1931 -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----
+
.Example output when the release-image uses the `multi` payload:
[source,terminal]
----
{"release.openshift.io architecture":"multi"}
----
+
The release image is found in the content digest and you can access your release image by running the `./openshift-install version` command. With the `multi` installer binary, your cluster supports `arm64`, `amd64`, `s390x`, and `ppc64le`. Otherwise, you can only install the architecture defined in the `release architecture` output from the `openshift-install version` command.
