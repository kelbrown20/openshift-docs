To upgrade your cluster with multi-architecture compute machines from {product-title} version {product-version} to a version 4.12 cluster, you must use the `candidate-4.12` update channel. For more information, see "Understanding upgrade channels". 

If you want to  upgrade your cluster to a specific {product-version} z-stream version, you can perform the following explicit upgrade command.
